# What we've done

## Git

- We created a git repo. Then we cloned it into a new directory.
- We modified .gitignore to ignore unnecessary files (like data files).

## Conda env

We created a conda environment using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

## Package

We created our own package called `altitude_dept` with a function to read the data file.

## Folders

We created a `notebooks` folder to store our Jupyter notebooks.
And a data folder to store our data files.
